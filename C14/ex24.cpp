/*
Take the example CopyConstructor.cpp and modify it by
adding your own copy-constructor to Child without
calling the base-class copy-constructor and see what //Default constructor is called
happens. Fix the problem by making a proper explicit
call to the base-class copy constructor in the constructorinitializer
list of the Child copy-constructor.
